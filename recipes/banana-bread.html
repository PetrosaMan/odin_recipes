<h2>Banana Bread Recipe</h2>

<p>This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana flavor.</p>
<p>Why compromise the banana flavor?</p>
<p>Friends and family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
    <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
    <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
    <li>Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
    <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
    <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
    <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
